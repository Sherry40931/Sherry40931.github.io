This is the very first post of this blog. The trigger that motivates me to start this blog is the need to store my reading notes for research paper. As the amount reading grows, it is getting hard to recall all of them. Therefore I think blogging might be a good way to archive and retrieve this notes and memories.

This blog is also a place to document my development experiences for future reference, a platform to practice my English writing, and a personal side project to learn web programming.
